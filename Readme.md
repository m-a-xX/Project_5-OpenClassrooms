# Use public data from OpenFoodFacts

This is the fifth project of the Python OpenClassrooms formation.
The principle of the program to be designed for the startup Pur Beurre is to offer people healthier substitutes for the products they are looking for in order to improve their diet. The program therefore makes it possible to consult the product categories, then to choose a product to consult the product sheet of its substitute, and if the user wishes it to save the result of the search in a DB to consult it later.

## MySQL settings
Please enter your MySQL login and password in the conf.py file.

## Start the program
To launch the program, all you need to do is clone the repo on your computer and run the main.py file. You must have Python 3 installed on your computer and have installed the requierments.

## Features
